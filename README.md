In this code i used Let ball, Let ySpeed, Let colours, and let index to declare the named of codes.
The set up function basically initializes the canvas size and and sets up parimeters and no stroke is used for drawing.
and the code if mouse is pressed basically means that it it is pressed the code will run the red backgroundand create random circles
and if it is not pressed it will run a black background.
it also draws random horizontal position and update its vertical position based on the ySpeed.
The ball bounces up and down within the canvas that is 400 by 200
the background turns red and random circles appear
The colors array determines how the ellipse at the mouse position is colored.
